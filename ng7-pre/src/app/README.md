The most basic building block of your Angular 7 application (and this is a concept that's not new) is the component. A component consists of three primary elements:

* The HTML template
* The logic
* The styling (CSS, Sass, Stylus, etc..)

When a new project is created, Angular generates a single component, with HTML, styling, and script:

* /app.component.html
* /app.component.scss
* /app.component.ts

For this tutorial, we've generated four additional components:

* nav
* about
* contact
* home

To generate a new component, use the following syntax:  `ng generate component component-name`.  You can also use shorthand syntax, like this:  `ng g c component-name`.

We've also generated a service: **data**

To generate a new service, use the following syntax:  `ng generate service service-name`  You can also use shorthand syntax, like this:  `ng g s servicej-name`.
